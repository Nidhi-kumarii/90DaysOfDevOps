## Why Branching Strategies Are Important
Branching is a powerful feature of Git that allows developers to work on different parts of a project independently. Hereâ€™s why branching strategies matter:

 1. Isolating Features and Bug Fixes
Branches allow developers to work on features or bug fixes in isolation from the main codebase. This prevents half-done code or bugs from affecting the main product

2. Facilitating Parallel Development
Multiple developers or teams can work on different branches simultaneously without interfering with each other's work â€” speeding up development.

3. Reducing Merge Conflicts
Structured branching (like feature/, bugfix/, release/) helps avoid code conflicts and keeps changes organized.

4.Enabling Effective Code Reviews
Pull Requests (PRs) from feature branches make it easier for reviewers to see what changed and give feedback before merging into main or master.


Common  Branching Strategies


| Strategy        | Purpose                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `main`/`master` | Stable production-ready code                |
| `develop`       | Integration branch for feature branches     |
| `feature/*`     | For developing new features                 |
| `bugfix/*`      | For fixing small issues                     |
| `hotfix/*`      | Urgent fixes for production                 |
| `release/*`     | Pre-release final testing and prep branches |
