Linux 

Linux is the backbone of many DevOps workflows and infrastructure, making it essential to master its core concepts and commands. In Week 2 of my journey, I focused on foundational Linux administration topics including user and group management, file permissions, volume management, networking, and powerful text-processing tools like awk, sed, and grep. Here’s a detailed look at what I learned and practiced.

Task 1

1. User & Group Management
Linux uses users and groups to control system access and resource permissions.

Users represent individual accounts on the system.

Groups are collections of users sharing common permissions.

Key system files:

/etc/passwd — stores user account information.

/etc/group — defines groups and their members.
